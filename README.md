This project is a platform designed to empower rural artisans in India by providing a digital space to showcase their traditional crafts, textiles, and handicrafts. It aims to connect these talented artisans with a global audience, promoting cultural heritage and supporting sustainable livelihoods.

The platform is built using React.js for an intuitive and dynamic frontend experience, Node.js for a scalable and efficient backend, and MongoDB for robust and flexible data management. By leveraging modern full-stack technologies, this project aspires to bridge the gap between local artisans and the global marketplace, creating opportunities for growth and recognition.

Join us in celebrating India's rich traditions while fostering a meaningful impact on the lives of rural artisans.
